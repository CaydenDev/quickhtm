# Markdown to HTML Test

This is a test document to demonstrate the features of our markdown converter.

## Text Formatting

You can make text **bold** or *italic*. You can also use `inline code` for technical terms.

## Code Blocks

Here's an example of a code block:

```
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

## Paragraphs

This is a paragraph.
Even though this is on a new line,
it will be joined into a single paragraph.

But this is a new paragraph because there's a blank line above it.
